# Topology-Optimization

The topology optimization code to design a cantilever beam. The code minimizes the compliance of the cantilever.
The SIMP method with gradient filtering is employed to reduce mesh dependence and checkerboarding. 
The Sigmund's 99 - line topology optimization code is used for this case.
